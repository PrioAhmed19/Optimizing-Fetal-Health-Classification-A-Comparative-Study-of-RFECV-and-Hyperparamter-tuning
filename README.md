The objective of the fetal health classifier model project is to develop an accurate and reliable machine learning model using the CTG dataset. Leveraging advanced algorithms, the aim is to classify fetal health based on cardiotocography (CTG) features. The project seeks to provide a tool for healthcare practitioners, and aid them to diagnose fetal health complications.

Process Pipeline

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data, addressing missing values and outliers. Normalize or standardize features, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Implement feature engineering techniques to enhance the model's ability to capture patterns in the fetal health data. Consider domain-specific knowledge to select and create meaningful features.

Algorithm Selection: Choose machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks. Consider algorithms such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Logistic regression based on the nature of the fetal health data.

Model Development: Train and develop the selected machine learning model using the preprocessed dataset. Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance, and utilize cross-validation to assess generalization.
