The project aims to conduct a comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms using the CTG dataset to develop a fetal health classifier model. The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of feature selection with Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

Process Pipeline

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and outliers. Apply normalization or standardization techniques to scale features appropriately. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution.

Feature Selection with RFECV: Implement RFECV to automatically select the optimal subset of features that contribute most to the classification task. Evaluate the impact of feature selection on model performance.

Algorithm Selection: Explore various machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks. Compare the performance of algorithms such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression.

Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV: Utilize GridSearchCV to systematically search for the best combination of hyperparameters for each algorithm. Fine-tune model parameters to optimize performance and enhance generalization.

Model Development and Evaluation: Train and evaluate the selected machine learning models using the preprocessed dataset. Assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques.

This approach facilitates a thorough analysis of different machine learning algorithms and techniques, enabling the selection of the most effective approach for fetal health classification.
